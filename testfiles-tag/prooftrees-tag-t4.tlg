TEST 1: prooftrees-tag-t4

! Package prooftrees Error: Prooftrees is currently incompatible with tagging. The safest approach is to compile tableaux standalone and include as images with detailed alt text..
See the prooftrees package documentation for explanation.

Since you insist, you can enable basic tagging support by loading prooftrees-debug after prooftrees. The code certainly requires LuaLaTeX and probably produces an invalid structure, but verapdf validates it and the code produces alt text automatically. I do not know how to make the structure valid. For a logic package, this is doubly unfortunate.
