## Features

This package supports drawing tableaux (proof trees) of the kind often used in
introductory logic classes, especially those aimed at students without strong
mathemtical backgrounds. Hodges (1991) is one example of a text which uses
this system. When teaching such a system it is especially useful to annotate
the tree with line numbers, justifications and explanations of branch
closures. 

prooftrees provides a single environment - either prooftree or tableau - and a
variety of tools for annotating, customising and highlighting such trees. A 
cross-referencing system is provided for trees which cite line numbers in 
justifications for proof lines or branch closures.

prooftrees is based on Forest and, hence, TikZ. The package requires version
2.1+ of Forest for expected results and will not work with version 1.

Version 0.9 adds out-of-the-box support for externalisation of tableaux using
memoize.
